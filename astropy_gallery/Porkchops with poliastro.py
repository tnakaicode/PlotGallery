# ## Porkchops with poliastro
# 
# Porkchops are also known as mission design curves since they show different parameters used to design the ballistic trajectories for the targetting problem such us:
# 
# * Time of flight (TFL)
# * Launch energy (C3L)
# * Arrival velocity (VHP)
# 
# For the moment, poliastro is only capable of creating these mission plots between `poliastro.bodies` objects. However, it is intended for future versions to make it able for plotting porkchops between NEOs also.
# 

# ### Basic modules
# For creating a porkchop plot with poliastro, we need to import the `porkchop` function from the `poliastro.plotting.porkchop` module. Also, two `poliastro.bodies` are necessary for computing the targetting problem associated. Finally by making use of `time_range`, a very useful function available at `poliastro.utils` it is possible to define a span of launching and arrival dates for the problem.

import astropy.units as u

from poliastro.plotting.porkchop import porkchop
from poliastro.bodies import Earth, Mars
from poliastro.util import time_range

launch_span = time_range("2005-04-30", end="2005-10-07")
arrival_span = time_range("2005-11-16", end="2006-12-21")


# ### Plot that porkchop!
# 
# All that we must do is pass the two bodies, the two time spans and some extra plotting parameters realted to different information along the figure such us:
# 
# * If we want poliastro to plot time of flight lines: `tfl=True/False`
# * If we want poliastro to plot arrival velocity: `vhp=True/False`
# * The maximum value for C3 to be ploted: `max_c3=45 * u.km**2 / u.s**2` (by default)

dv_dpt, dv_arr, c3dpt, c3arr, tof = porkchop(Earth, Mars, 
                                             launch_span, arrival_span)


# ### NASA's same porkchop
# 
# We can compare previous porkchop with the ones made by NASA for those years.
