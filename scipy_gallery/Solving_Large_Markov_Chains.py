# Solving large Markov Chains
# ===========================
# 
# This page shows how to compute the stationary distribution pi of a large
# Markov chain. The example is a tandem of two M/M/1 queues. Generally the
# transition matrix P of the Markov chain is sparse, so that we can either
# use scipy.sparse or Pysparse. Here we demonstrate how to use both of
# these tools.
# 
# Power Method
# ------------
# 
# In this section we find pi by means of iterative methods called the
# Power method. More specifically, given a (stochastic) transition matrix
# P, and an initial vector pi\_0, compute iteratively pi\_n = pi\_{n-1} P
# until the distance (in some norm) between pi\_n and pi\_{n-1} is small
# enough.
# 
# Fist we build the generator matrix Q for the related Markov chain. Then
# we turn Q into a transition matrix P by the method of uniformization,
# that is, we define P as I - Q/l, where I is the identity matrix (of the
# same size as Q) and l is the smallest element on the diagonal of Q. Once
# we have P, we approximate pi (the left eigenvector of P that satisfies
# pi = pi P) by the iterates pi\_n = pi\_0 P\^n, for some initial vector
# pi\_0.
# 
# More details of the above approach can be found in (more or less) any
# book on probability and Markov Chains. A fine example, with many nice
# examples and attention to the numerical solution of Markov chains, is
# \`Queueing networks and Markov Chains' by G. Bolch et al., John Wiley,
# 2nd edition, 2006.
