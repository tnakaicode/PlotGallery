# wxPython dialogs
# ================
# 
# Something I enjoy in matlab is the ease in which simple file selector
# dialogs, and status bars can be made. Now that I use nothing but scipy,
# I have wanted to have simliar functions for my scipy code. Thanks to the
# great reference ["wxPython in Action"](http://www.manning.com/rappin/) I
# have learned some of the basics again, with the promise of making very
# fancy GUIs if I ever find the urge! (Check out the sample chapters, they
# have given the entire section on making dialogs, which is how I
# initially got started with wxPython).
# 
# File Selector Dialog
# --------------------
# 
# I often write simple translation scripts that convert some data, into
# another form. I like to use these for a series of data, and share them
# with some coworkers who do not program. the wxPython FileSelector
# function comes to the rescue.

# In[ ]:


import wx

# setup the GUI main loop
app = wx.App()

filename = wx.FileSelector()


# With this basic code, filename contains a string pathname (may be
# unicode depending on your installation of wxPython, more on this latter)
# of the selected file.
# 
# Some of the spiffing up will include using the current directory the
# script was started in, we do this easily

# In[ ]:


import wx
import os

# setup the GUI main loop
app = wx.App()

filename = wx.FileSelector(default_path=os.getcwd())


# If one runs such script repeatedly, it might be a good idea to do some
# basic clean-up after each run.

# In[ ]:


# ...
app.Destroy()
