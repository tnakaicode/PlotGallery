# Savitzky Golay Filtering
# ========================
# 
# The Savitzky Golay filter is a particular type of low-pass filter, well
# adapted for data smoothing. For further information see:
# <http://www.wire.tu-bs.de/OLDWEB/mameyer/cmr/savgol.pdf> (or
# <http://www.dalkescientific.com/writings/NBN/data/savitzky_golay.py> for
# a pre-numpy implementation).
# 
# Sample Code
# -----------

# In[ ]:


#!python
def savitzky_golay(y, window_size, order, deriv=0, rate=1):
    r"""Smooth (and optionally differentiate) data with a Savitzky-Golay filter.
    The Savitzky-Golay filter removes high frequency noise from data.
    It has the advantage of preserving the original shape and
    features of the signal better than other types of filtering
    approaches, such as moving averages techniques.
    Parameters
    ----------
    y : array_like, shape (N,)
        the values of the time history of the signal.
    window_size : int
        the length of the window. Must be an odd integer number.
    order : int
        the order of the polynomial used in the filtering.
        Must be less then `window_size` - 1.
    deriv: int
        the order of the derivative to compute (default = 0 means only smoothing)
    Returns
    -------
    ys : ndarray, shape (N)
        the smoothed signal (or it's n-th derivative).
    Notes
    -----
    The Savitzky-Golay is a type of low-pass filter, particularly
    suited for smoothing noisy data. The main idea behind this
    approach is to make for each point a least-square fit with a
    polynomial of high order over a odd-sized window centered at
    the point.
    Examples
    --------
    t = np.linspace(-4, 4, 500)
    y = np.exp( -t**2 ) + np.random.normal(0, 0.05, t.shape)
    ysg = savitzky_golay(y, window_size=31, order=4)
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.plot(t, y, label='Noisy signal')
    plt.plot(t, np.exp(-t**2), 'k', lw=1.5, label='Original signal')
    plt.plot(t, ysg, 'r', label='Filtered signal')
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

# Code explanation
# ----------------
# 
# In lines 61-62 the coefficients of the local least-square polynomial fit
# are pre-computed. These will be used later at line 68, where they will
# be correlated with the signal. To prevent spurious results at the
# extremes of the data, the signal is padded at both ends with its mirror
# image, (lines 65-67).

# -------------------------------------
# 
# One of the most popular applications of S-G filter, apart from smoothing
# UV-VIS and IR spectra, is smoothing of curves obtained in
# electroanalytical experiments. In cyclic voltammetry, voltage (being the
# abcissa) changes like a triangle wave. And in the signal there are cusps
# at the turning points (at switching potentials) which should never be
# smoothed. In this case, Savitzky-Golay smoothing should be done
# piecewise, ie. separately on pieces monotonic in x:

# Two dimensional data smoothing and least-square gradient estimate
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# Savitsky-Golay filters can also be used to smooth two dimensional data
# affected by noise. The algorithm is exactly the same as for the one
# dimensional case, only the math is a bit more tricky. The basic
# algorithm is as follow: 1. for each point of the two dimensional matrix
# extract a sub-matrix, centered at that point and with a size equal to an
# odd number "window\_size". 2. for this sub-matrix compute a least-square
# fit of a polynomial surface, defined as p(x,y) = a0 + a1\*x + a2\*y +
# a3\*x\^2 + a4\*y\^2 + a5\*x\*y + ... . Note that x and y are equal to
# zero at the central point. 3. replace the initial central point with the
# value computed with the fit.
# 
# Note that because the fit coefficients are linear with respect to the
# data spacing, they can pre-computed for efficiency. Moreover, it is
# important to appropriately pad the borders of the data, with a mirror
# image of the data itself, so that the evaluation of the fit at the
# borders of the data can happen smoothly.
# 
# Here is the code for two dimensional filtering.

# ## Gradient of a two-dimensional function
# 
# Since we have computed the best fitting interpolating polynomial surface it is easy to compute its gradient. This method of computing the gradient of a two dimensional function is quite robust, and partially hides the noise in the data, which strongly affects the differentiation operation. The maximum order of the derivative that can be computed obviously depends on the order of the polynomial used in the fitting.
# 
# The code provided above have an option `derivative`, which as of now allows to compute the first derivative of the 2D data. It can be "row"or "column", indicating the direction of the derivative, or "both", which returns the gradient.
