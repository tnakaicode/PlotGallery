# Matplotlib: drag'n'drop text example
# ======================================================================
#
# introduction
# ------------
#
# Matplotlib provides event handling to determine things like key presses,
# mouse position, and button clicks. Matplotlib supports a number of GUIs,
# and provides an interface to the GUI event handling via the mpl\_connect
# and mpl\_disconnect methods.
#
# This page gives an example of use of these facilities by adding a
# Drag'n'Drop handler for text objects. You can get the source code for
# this example here: [Text_DragnDrop_v0.1.py](files/attachments/Matplotlib_Drag_n_Drop_Text_Example/Text_DragnDrop_v0.1.py) .)
#
# Defining the handler class

# A small use case
# ----------------


#! python numbers=disable

# Usage example
# Create arbitrary points and labels
x, y = random.normal(5, 2, size=(2, 9))
labels = ["Point %d" % i for i in range(x.size)]

# trace a scatter plot
p.scatter(x, y)
p.grid()

# add labels and set their picker attribute to True
for a, b, l in zip(x, y, labels):
    p.text(a, b, l, picker=True)

# Create the event hendler
dragh = DragHandler()

p.show()


# The Text objects can now be moved with the mouse.
