# Filtfilt
# ======================================================================
# 
# This sample code demonstrates the use of the function
# scipy.signal.filtfilt, a linear filter that achieves zero phase delay by
# applying an [IIR
# filter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_impulse_response) to a
# signal twice, once forwards and once backwards. The order of the filter
# is twice the original filter order. The function also computes the
# initial filter parameters in order to provide a more stable response
# (via lfilter\_zi).
# 
# For comparison, this script also applies the same IIR filter to the
# signal using scipy.signal.lfilter; for these calculations, lfilter\_zi
# is used to choose appropriate initial conditions for the filter. Without
# this, these plots would have long transients near 0. As it is, they have
# long transients near the initial value of the signal.
